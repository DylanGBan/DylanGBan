## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Dylan Banerjee! I am a fourth year Mathematics-Computer Science major at the University of Calfornia San Diego. 

- Here's my personal website: https://dylangban.github.io/dylan-banerjee-portfolio/
- I also have class projects that I have worked on at UCSD, but since I am still a student at the university, I cannot make
  the repositories public. Here is a list of my class projects so far:
  - CSE 120 (Operating Systems) ~ Using Nachos as a playground to put into practice material learned in class (eg. threads, context-switches, scheduling, etc.)
  - CSE 105 (Theory of Computation) ~ Coded two files in Java that
      1) Helps prove that the language ADFA is a decidable language as it can be witnessed by a deciding Turing Machine.
      2) Proves that:

      ```math
      \overline{HALT_{TM}} \leq_{m} DEC_{TM}
      ```
      by mapping
      
      ```math
      \phi:\overline{HALT_{TM}} \to DEC_{TM} ~|~\forall x \in \overline{HALT_{TM}} : \phi(x) \in DEC_{TM}
      ```
      
      ```math
      \phi:\overline{HALT_{TM}} \to DEC_{TM} ~|~\forall x \not\in \overline{HALT_{TM}} : \phi(x) \not\in DEC_{TM}
      ```
  - COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice) ~ A project using techniques learned in class about data science. This includes various graphs and training/using a linear regression model.
